# Pong
This is a simple remake of the classic arcade game Pong. The game stays to the original rules. The goal is to cause the opponent to miss the balls with their paddle and send the ball off the screen on the x-axis. If you accomplish this you get a point. There is no pre-defined point limit to end the game, play until you are content!
